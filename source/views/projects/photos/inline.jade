    .textblock - Designed to be quick and easy: a div tag with the gallery's #ID will load photos from the directory of the same name.
    .textblock - Loading steps: 
        ul.inline
            li= 'A <div> tag with .gallery class is detected and'
                +link('https://github.com/crystol/gnaoh/blob/master/source/js/gnaoh.js#L250', 'gnaoh.loadGallery()') is called.
            li Options are extracted from the div tag and applied:
                ul
                    li id = 'ID' : Source directory/path of the photos (ex: /static/img/gallery/ID/).
                    li data-start = '1'' : Starting index (photos are named with /\d{1}\.jpg/ pattern).
                    li data-captions='true' : Specifies if a captions exist.
            li= 'The loop creates and appends <img> tags to the gallery.'
            li An AJAX request is made to obtain the 
                +link('/static/img/gallery/sample/captions.JSON', 'JSON') file with the captions.
            li Separate loop matches the caption to the proper photo according to its key:value pair.
    .textblock - Logic and thoughts:
        ul.inline
            li Quick and easy way to load series of photos exported from Photoshop/Lightroom.
            li This method allows the page to load (DOMready ~500ms) without hindrance. 
            li The progressive photos takeare asynchronously loaded 
            li Will NOT work with browsers sans javascript. A future revision will port this function to Node.js and have the backend generate the markup instead.
